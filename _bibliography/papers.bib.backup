abstract = {Microservices-based Architectures (MSAs) are gaining popularity since, among others, they enable rapid and independent delivery of software at scale, facilitating the delivery of business value. Additionally, there are attempts towards understanding practitioners’ roles and technical knowledge. MSAs call for affinity in several technologies as well as business domains. This diversity makes it challenging to scope and describe the roles of practitioners. In addition, practitioners often do not receive training and contents of MSA training remain largely undefined, even though there are challenges in finding or developing relevant technical expertise. In this research, we determine the different technical roles that are required in MSAs, along with their detailed competences. We use public online forums (e.g., StackOverflow), where developers share technical knowledge. We analyze 13,517 public profiles of software engineers, deriving their technical competences. Our taxonomy of technical competences in MSAs, contains 11 competences clusters, organized in 3 collections of competences — Web Technologies, DevOps, and Data Technologies. In addition, we derive the roles of microservice practitioners and the characteristics of their roles. Our findings organize the technical competences of MSAs practitioners and determine the training topics and combination of topics that can prepare engineers for MSAs.},

abstract = {Modern compilers often offer a variety of warning flags, which developers can enable to get feedback on code that, while syntactically correct, may be problematic. In the case of C++, one example of such "correct but problematic" code is code that leads to undefined behavior (UB). The usage of compiler warnings has long been suspected as a way to decrease bugs and increase code quality. However, empirical evidence that supports this hypothesis is rare. In this study, we present evidence from a study of 127 open source C++ projects. We categorize their usage of compiler warnings into five groups based on which warning flags are being used, and analyse the relationship between compiler warnings and five quality metrics (bugs, critical issues, vulnerabilities, code smells, and technical debt) using Bayesian analysis. We conclude that, in general, compiler warnings indeed correlate with, and potentially cause, higher code quality, with the clearest impact being on the number of critical issues in a project. Using stricter warning flags expectantly correlates with higher code quality in our study objects. However, there are substantial differences between projects, which we attribute to the project's individual development culture. That is, while warnings matter, other factors such as quality culture, are likely to be even more important to source code quality.},

abstract = {Today's software is bloated with both code and features that are not used by most users. This bloat is prevalent across the entire software stack, from operating systems and applications to containers. Containers are lightweight virtualization technologies used to package code and dependencies, providing portable, reproducible and isolated environments. For their ease of use, data scientists often utilize machine learning containers to simplify their workflow. However, this convenience comes at a cost: containers are often bloated with unnecessary code and dependencies, resulting in very large sizes. In this paper, we analyze and quantify bloat in machine learning containers. We develop MMLB, a framework for analyzing bloat in software systems, focusing on machine learning containers. MMLB measures the amount of bloat at both the container and package levels, quantifying the sources of bloat. In addition, MMLB integrates with vulnerability analysis tools and performs package dependency analysis to evaluate the impact of bloat on container vulnerabilities. Through experimentation with 15 machine learning containers from TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Nvidia, we show that bloat accounts for up to 80\% of machine learning container sizes, increasing container provisioning times by up to 370\% and exacerbating vulnerabilities by up to 99\%.},

This study extends our previous work by introducing a batch-mode deep active learning approach tailored for regression in graph-structured data. Our framework leverages the source code conversion into Flow Augmented-AST graphs (FA-AST), subsequently utilizing both supervised and unsupervised graph embeddings. In contrast to single-instance querying, the batch-mode paradigm adaptively selects clusters of unlabeled data for labelling. We deploy an array of base kernels, kernel transformations, and selection methods, informed by both Bayesian and non-Bayesian strategies, to enhance the sample efficiency of neural network regression. Our experimental evaluation, conducted on multiple real-world software performance datasets, demonstrates the efficacy of the batch mode deep active learning approach in achieving robust performance with a reduced labelling budget. The methodology scales effectively to larger datasets and requires minimal alterations to existing neural network architectures.},

There is little empirical evidence showing how migration projects take place. Investigating migration activities and the perceived impact of migrations from practitioners is important to understand how migration projects materialize. In this study, we ask 54 practitioners about their views on specific aspects of microservices migrations. Specifically, we derive the sequence of migration activities as well as the perceived impact of microservices on the development process. Database refactoring, back-end refactoring, and setting up DevOps tend to take place before front-end refactoring, setting up communication patterns, and splitting teams. In addition, aligning teams with profitable value propositions, improving the testing process, and having fewer dependencies between teams are among the prominent impact areas of microservices. Our results call for further empirical research in understanding transitions toward MSAs.},

abstract = {Software performance changes are costly and often hard to detect pre-release. Similar to software testing frameworks, either application benchmarks or microbenchmarks can be integrated into quality assurance pipelines to detect performance changes before releasing a new application version. Unfortunately, extensive benchmarking studies usually take several hours which is problematic when examining dozens of daily code changes in detail; hence, trade-offs have to be made. Optimized microbenchmark suites, which only include a small subset of the full suite, are a potential solution for this problem, given that they still reliably detect the majority of the application performance changes such as an increased request latency. It is, however, unclear whether microbenchmarks and application benchmarks detect the same performance problems and one can be a proxy for the other. In this paper, we explore whether microbenchmark suites can detect the same application performance changes as an application benchmark. For this, we run extensive benchmark experiments with both the complete and the optimized microbenchmark suites of the two time-series database systems InfluxDB and VictoriaMetrics and compare their results to the results of corresponding application benchmarks. We do this for 70 and 110 commits, respectively. Our results show that it is possible to detect application performance changes using an optimized microbenchmark suite if frequent false-positive alarms can be tolerated.},

abstract="Predicting the performance of production code prior to actual execution is known to be highly challenging. In this paper, we propose a predictive model, dubbed  TEP-GNN, which demonstrates that high-accuracy performance prediction is possible for the special case of predicting unit test execution times.  TEP-GNN uses FA-ASTs, or flow-augmented ASTs, as a graph-based code representation approach, and predicts test execution times using a powerful graph neural network (GNN) deep learning model. We evaluate  TEP-GNN using four real-life Java open source programs, based on 922 test files mined from the projects' public repositories. We find that our approach achieves a high Pearson correlation of 0.789, considerable outperforming a baseline deep learning model. Our work demonstrates that FA-ASTs and GNNs are a feasible approach for predicting absolute performance values, and serves as an important intermediary step towards being able to predict the performance of arbitrary code prior to execution.",

abstract = {Performance is a crucial non-functional requirement of many software systems. Despite the widespread use of performance testing, developers still struggle to construct and evaluate the quality of performance tests. To address these two major challenges, we implement a framework, dubbed ju2jmh, to automatically generate performance microbenchmarks from JUnit tests and use mutation testing to study the quality of generated microbenchmarks. Specifically, we compare our ju2jmh generated benchmarks to manually written JMH benchmarks and to automatically generated JMH benchmarks using the AutoJMH framework, as well as directly measuring system performance with JUnit tests. For this purpose, we have conducted a study on three subjects (Rxjava, Eclipse-collections, and Zipkin) with <inline-formula><tex-math notation="LaTeX">$sim$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href="tang-ieq1-3188005.gif"/></alternatives></inline-formula>454K <italic>source lines of code</italic> (SLOC), 2,417 JMH benchmarks (including manually written and generated AutoJMH benchmarks) and 35,084 JUnit tests. Our results show that the <italic>ju2jmh</italic> generated JMH benchmarks consistently outperform using the execution time and throughput of JUnit tests as a proxy of performance and JMH benchmarks automatically generated using the AutoJMH framework while being comparable to JMH benchmarks manually written by developers in terms of tests’ stability and ability to detect performance bugs. Nevertheless, <italic>ju2jmh</italic> benchmarks are able to cover more of the software applications than manually written JMH benchmarks during the microbenchmark execution. Furthermore, <italic>ju2jmh</italic> benchmarks are generated automatically, while manually written JMH benchmarks require many hours of hard work and attention; therefore our study can reduce developers’ effort to construct microbenchmarks. In addition, we identify three factors (too low test workload, unstable tests and limited mutant coverage) that affect a benchmark's ability to detect performance bugs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study aimed at assisting developers in fully automated microbenchmark creation and assessing microbenchmark quality for performance testing.},

abstract = {The usage of deep learning (DL) approaches for software engineering has attracted much attention, particularly in source code modelling and analysis. However, in order to use DL, source code needs to be formatted to fit the expected input form of DL models. This problem is known as source code representation. Source code can be represented via different approaches, most importantly, the tree-based, token-based, and graph-based approaches. We use a systematic mapping study to investigate i detail the representation approaches adopted in 103 studies that use DL in the context of software engineering. Thus, studies are collected from 2014 to 2021 from 14 different journals and 27 conferences. We show that each way of representing source code can provide a different, yet orthogonal view of the same source code. Thus, different software engineering tasks might require different (combinations of) code representation approaches, depending on the nature and complexity of the task. Particularly, we show that it is crucial to define whether the DL approach requires lexical, syntactical, or semantic code information. Our analysis shows that a wide range of different representations and combinations of representations (hybrid representations) are used to solve a wide range of common software engineering problems. However, we also observe that current research does not generally attempt to transfer existing representations or models to other studies even though there are other contexts in which these representations and models may also be useful. We believe that there is potential for more reuse and the application of transfer learning when applying DL to software engineering tasks.},

abstract = {Over the last five years, all major cloud platform providers have increased their serverless offerings. Many early adopters report significant benefits for serverless-based over traditional applications, and many companies are considering moving to serverless themselves. However, currently there exist only few, scattered, and sometimes even conflicting reports on when serverless applications are well suited and what the best practices for their implementation are. We address this problem in the present study about the state of serverless applications. We collect descriptions of 89 serverless applications from open-source projects, academic literature, industrial literature, and domain-specific feedback. We analyze 16 characteristics that describe why and when successful adopters are using serverless applications, and how they are building them. We further compare the results of our characterization study to 10 existing, mostly industrial, studies and datasets; this allows us to identify points of consensus across multiple studies, investigate points of disagreement, and overall confirm the validity of our results. The results of this study can help managers to decide if they should adopt serverless technology, engineers to learn about current practices of building serverless applications, and researchers and platform providers to better understand the current landscape of serverless applications.},

abstract = {Background: Microservices migrations are challenging and expensive projects with many decisions that need to be made in a multitude of dimensions. Existing research tends to focus on technical issues and decisions (e.g., how to split services). Equally important organizational or business issues and their relations with technical aspects often remain out of scope or on a high level of abstraction.Aims: In this study, we aim to holistically chart the decision-making that happens on all dimensions of a migration project towards microservices (including, but not limited to, the technical dimension).Method: We investigate 16 different migration cases in a grounded theory interview study, with 19 participants that recently migrated towards microservices. This study strongly focuses on the human aspects of a migration, through stakeholders and their decisions.Results: We identify 3 decision-making processes consisting of 22 decision-points and their alternative options. The decision-points are related to creating stakeholder engagement and assessing feasibility, technical implementation, and organizational restructuring.Conclusions: Our study provides an initial theory of decisionmaking in migrations to microservices. It also outfits practitioners with a roadmap of which decisions they should be prepared to make and at which point in the migration.},

  abstract  = {Enhancing customer relationships through social media is an area of high relevance for companies. To this aim, Social Business Intelligence (SBI) plays a crucial role by supporting companies in combining corporate data with user-generated content, usually available as textual clips on social media. Unfortunately, SBI research is often constrained by the lack of publicly-available, real-world data for experimental activities. In this paper, we describe our experience in extracting social data and processing them through an enrichment pipeline for brand analysis. As a first step, we collect texts from social media and we annotate them based on predefined metrics for brand analysis, using features such as sentiment and geolocation. Annotations rely on various learning and natural language processing approaches, including deep learning and geographical ontologies. Structured data obtained from the annotation process are then stored in a distributed data warehouse for further analysis. Preliminary results, obtained from the analysis of three well known ICT brands, using data gathered from Twitter, news portals, and Amazon product reviews, show that different evaluation metrics can lead to different outcomes, indicating that no single metric is dominant for all brand analysis use cases.},

	abstract="Rigorous performance engineering traditionally assumes measuring on bare-metal environments to control for as many confounding factors as possible. Unfortunately, some researchers and practitioners might not have access, knowledge, or funds to operate dedicated performance-testing hardware, making public clouds an attractive alternative. However, shared public cloud environments are inherently unpredictable in terms of the system performance they provide. In this study, we explore the effects of cloud environments on the variability of performance test results and to what extent slowdowns can still be reliably detected even in a public cloud. We focus on software microbenchmarks as an example of performance tests and execute extensive experiments on three different well-known public cloud services (AWS, GCE, and Azure) using three different cloud instance types per service. We also compare the results to a hosted bare-metal offering from IBM Bluemix. In total, we gathered more than 4.5 million unique microbenchmarking data points from benchmarks written in Java and Go. We find that the variability of results differs substantially between benchmarks and instance types (by a coefficient of variation from 0.03{\%} to >{\thinspace}100{\%}). However, executing test and control experiments on the same instances (in randomized order) allows us to detect slowdowns of 10{\%} or less with high confidence, using state-of-the-art statistical tests (i.e., Wilcoxon rank-sum and overlapping bootstrapped confidence intervals). Finally, our results indicate that Wilcoxon rank-sum manages to detect smaller slowdowns in cloud environments.",
