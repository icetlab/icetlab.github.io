<b> Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto </b>

I am a Senior Lecturer in Software Engineering at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden. My main research areas are: Automated Software Testing, (AI) Bots to aid Software Engineers, and Scalable and Inclusive Software Engineering Education. Check out my google scholar page and some of my papers in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14901">FSE</a>, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9314270">TSE</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00933">JSS</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09065">PeerJ</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03824">ICSE-SEET</a>. This blend of areas show my personal interest in both the technical and human aspects of software engineering. I am also a regular reviewer for top journals such as TSE, EMSE, JSS, IST and TOCE.

Besides research and teaching, I serve as the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) representative for our Computer Science and Engineering department. In this role, I monitor and propose initiatives to foster a more equitable and supportive work environment within academia. I am a <a href="https://www.computer.org/publications/tech-news/insider-membership-news/excellence-in-stem-francisco-gomes-de-oliveira-neto">strong advocate for LGBTQIA+ inclusion and representation in academia</a> by coordinating two LGBTQIA+ groups within our undergraduate students and academic staff. I also co-organize <a href="https://chalmers.se/gcc">Girls Code Club</a>, a summer bootcamp to teach programming to high-school girls.
