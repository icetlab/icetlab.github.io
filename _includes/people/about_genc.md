<b>Ediz Genc</b>

I am a software engineer with an academic background in Software Engineering and Management, holding a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree candidate in the same field at the joint Computer Science and Engineering department of Chalmers and the University of Gothenburg. My work focuses on designing and implementing small/large-scale distributed systems, microservices, and end-to-end software solutions including cloud-based solutions, with experience spanning the full software lifecycleâ€”from conceptual design to the delivery of functional systems. I am particularly interested in the challenges of building scalable, efficient, and reliable software/systems that can address complex and evolving requirements. Through a combination of academic projects, internships, and professional experience in leading and high-impact domains of scientific research, aerospace, and telecommunications, I have developed an in-depth understanding of creating scalable and dependable software systems to meet diverse needs.
