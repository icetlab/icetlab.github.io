<b> Philipp Leitner </b>

I am an Associate Professor of Software Engineering at Chalmers, a private research university in Gothenburg, Sweden. My research interests are centered around measuring, predicting, and improving the performance of software systems, especially (but not only) in a cloud computing context, as well as on the usage of LLMs in modern software development.

I lead the Internet Computing and Emerging Technologies Lab (ICET-lab), a research group focussing on various aspects of Internet and cloud computing. I have published some 150 peer-reviewed publications on performance engineering, (micro-) services, cloud systems, and empirical software engineering, leading to an h-index of 48 as <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wZ9f8CAAAAAJ&hl=en">tracked by Google Scholar</a>. I am commonly publishing at and reviewing for top conferences and journals in the field, including ICSE, FSE, TSE, and EMSE.
