<b> Ranim Khojah </b>

I am a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, conducting research on the use of large language models in software engineering. I conduct my research under the supervision of <a href="http://philippleitner.net">Philipp Leitner</a> and <a href="https://www.gu.se/en/about/find-staff/franciscodeoliveiraneto">Francisco Gomes</a>. I hold a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a master's degree in Language Technology, both from the University of Gothenburg.
My current interests include chatbots that can assist with activities during the software development lifecycle, such as code generation, explanation, and completion.
