<b> Lirong Esme Yi </b>

I am a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, researching software optimization and code generation using large language models. My work is supervised by <a href="http://philippleitner.net">Philipp Leitner</a> and Gregory Gay.

Before joining Chalmers, I worked as a Compiler Engineer at IBM, contributing to the LLVM project. I hold both a bachelor's and a masterâ€™s degree in Software Engineering from Donghua University.
