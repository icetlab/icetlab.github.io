<b> Peter Samoaa </b>

I was a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, graduating with a dissertation "From Trees to Graphs: Advancing Regression Analysis through Model-Centric AI, Data-Centric AI, and Active Learning" in October 2024.

I conducted my PhD research under the supervision of Philipp Leitner and <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/en/persons/haghir/">Morteza Haghir Chehreghani</a>.
My research focused on analyzing the behavior of tree-based neural networks in regression tasks. I aimed to improve regression performance from both model-centric and data-centric perspectives. This included enhancing models through advanced algorithms and improving data quality by acquiring labels for graph data using active learning. My primary tool for graph regression analysis was Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). As part of my research, I used software performance prediction as a case study to validate my methods.
