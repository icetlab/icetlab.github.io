I was a PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, graduating with a dissertation "An Empirical Investigation of Microservices-based Software Architectures from a Socio-Technical Perspective" in May 2024.

I conducted my PhD research under the supervision of <a href="https://se.informatik.uni-rostock.de/team/lehrstuhlinhaber/prof-dr-rer-nat-regina-hebig/">Regina Hebig</a> and <a href="http://philippleitner.net">Philipp Leitner</a>.
I studied microservice architectures in practice, with a particular focus on human aspects.

Now a consultant at <a href="https://ictech.se">ICTech</a>.
