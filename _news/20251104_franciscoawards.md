This year Francisco has won **both**, the Chalmers Pedagogical Prize as well as the Chalmers Equality Prize!

---

Francisco has won the 2025 Chalmers Pedagogical Prize for "for his inclusiveness in teaching and the support he provided to students and staff members from underrepresented groups." Read more information about his inclusive pedagogical work as well as an interview [here](https://www.chalmers.se/en/current/news/teachers-awarded-for-inclusive-pedagogy/). This is Francisco's third pedagogical prize, following two awards at University of Gothenburg ("The IT Faculty Pedagogical Prize" in 2019, and also "IT-sektionens pedagogiska pris" in 2021, from the IT-Section of Chalmers Student Union).

Additionally, Francisco *also* won the 2025 Chalmers Equality Award for his long-term and dedicated efforts to create a more inclusive and equitable academic environment.

Both prizes will be awarded on Thursday, Nov. 6th 2025, as part of Chalmers' yearly [årshögtid](https://www.chalmers.se/aktuellt/kalender/chalmers-arshogtid/). Congratulations, Francisco!
