The Swedish Research Council (VR) has accepted our grant proposal **Fast-LLM - Can Large Language Models Synthesise Efficient Code?**

---

In this project, we will study the performance (and potentially other non-functional properties, such as energy efficiency) of LLM-generated code, and propose methods to make autogenerated code more efficient.

Expect call(s) for a PhD student / postdoc position to appear in the next weeks. If you are currently finishing your master or PhD and that project sounds cool to you please already get in touch!
