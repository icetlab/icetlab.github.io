Organizations in many industries are increasingly adopting Microservices-based Software Architectures (MSAs) for designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems, in order to scale-up their Development and Operations capabilities. However, transitioning to MSAs is easier said than done since:
* Microservices are not a silver bullet
* Changing Software Architectures are complex and time-consuming endeavours
* Software Architecture transitions require changes in technical, organizational and human aspects

ICET-lab follows empirical approaches in investigating migrations toward MSAs through a Socio-Technical perspective. Contributions in this area include:

* Decision-making processes for migrations to microservices.
* Aggregated migration journey from various organizations and technical solutions used by practitioners.
* Testing in microservices.
* Mining repositories and job-ads to unravel the roles, responsibilities and skills of engineers working with microservices.
