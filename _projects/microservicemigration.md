        <p>Organizations in many industries are increasingly adopting Microservices-based Software Architectures (MSAs) for designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems, in order to scale-up their Development and Operations capabilities. However, transitioning to MSAs is easier said than done.</p>

In our research, we primarily study the migration process to MSAs through a socio-technical lense. That is, we view microservices not only, or even primarily, as a technical solution, but as an organizational solution that involves people, processes, and technology.

Our contributions in this area include:

* Decision-making processes for migrations to microservices, and aggregated migration journeys from various organizations and technical solutions used by practitioners {% cite ayas:23 %}.
* Testing in microservices, particularly related to consumer-driven contract testing {% cite ayas:22 %}.
* Mining repositories and studying job-ads to classify the roles, responsibilities and skills of engineers working with microservices {% cite ayas:24:1} {% cite ayas:24}.
